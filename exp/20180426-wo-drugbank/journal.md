# Without Drugbank Experiment - TODO and Journal

- [x] Copy Go files from fillup-vs-not experiment
- [ ] Copy Go files again, after bugfixing in fillup-vs-not experiment
- [>] Clean up copied Go files of stuff not relevant to this experiment
- [>] Implement a map for looking up target/gene-specific cost values
  - [ ] Decide if we should do this by referring to the output of the
  previous experiment, and so get the full audit trail of that file into
  outputs of this workflow?
- [ ] Include relevant code (for figuring out drugbank active compounds) from
  the drugbank-vs-not experiment
