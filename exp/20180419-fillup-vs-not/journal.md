# Experiment journal for experiment: Compare fillup vs not fillup

Main points:

- [>] Run full workflow *with* fillup (of assumed non-actives)
- [>] Run full workflow *without* fillup (of assumed non-actives)
- Had started this workflow overnight on messi/cihost
- In the morning (today, April 20) it had stopped upon a non-existent directory
  causing a problem for a pure Go component. [Fixed it in scipipe now](https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe/commit/05b6a8).
- [ ] Do some proper statistics to say with confideince which one is (significantly) better.

Some more remaining points:

- [ ] Add calibration plot
