# Experiment journal for experiment: Compare fillup vs not fillup

Main points:

- [>] Run full workflow *with* fillup (of assumed non-actives)
- [>] Run full workflow *without* fillup (of assumed non-actives)
- [ ] Do some proper statistics to say with confideince which one is (significantly) better.

Some more remaining points:

- [ ] Add calibration plot
