Experiment Journal
==================

- [x] Copy the workflow from the previous fillup folder
- [x] Use new flag(s) for proper training set in CPSign
  - (`... crossvalidate --proper-trainfile`)
- [x] Fill up *to* 3x#actives, instead of *adding* 2x#actives new assumed negatives
- [x] Remove "target info" from names when training
- [x] Test re-run locally with 3 smallest target
- [x] Fix bug that makes the plot show the unfilled amount of non-actives in the plot
  - [x] Split up fill-up in two components: One that extracts the fill-up
    lines, and one that merges them with the existing data.
  - Note: Seems this might possibly have been caused by having multiple
    workflow runs going on at the same time. At least it worked better this
    time when running the small targets on cihost. 21 targets x 3 replicates,
    and no empty fillup files this time.
- [x] Fix minor thing making some file names contain two consecutive dots (`..`).
- [x] Figure out why validity is `0.000` in the latest run, and effiency and
  validity a bit too good.

  - Found it now: Had forgot to rename from "Validity" to "Accuracy" after
    name change in CPSign.
- [x] Implement date/time field in audit log.
- [x] Fix Validity->Accuracy name change
- [x] Re-run small datasets downstream of "extract_assumed_n_*" component,
      after fixing validity->accuracy name change
- [x] Add `--logfile` lines for each cpsign call
- [x] Fix bug: Filled-up dataset should go to proper-train, not the other way around
- [x] Fix further bug: *only* the assumed negatives should go to
      proper-train, not together with the original data
      - Including upgrade to CPSign 1.6.12, where Staffan fixed so that proper-train
        can actually take only non-actives ("N") without complaining.
- [x] Fix bug: Should count (orig) targetdata + assumed_n
- [x] Re-run on small datasets, after bugfixes
- [x] Figure out if there is something weird with the green line
  - Seems to be OK now
