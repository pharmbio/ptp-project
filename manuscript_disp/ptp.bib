abstract="A molecule editor, i.e. a program facilitating graphical input and interactive editing of molecules, is an indispensable part of every cheminformatics or molecular processing system. Today, when a web browser has become the universal scientific user interface, a tool to edit molecules directly within the web browser is essential. One of the most popular tools for molecular structure input on the web is the JME applet. Since its release nearly 15Â years ago, however the web environment has changed and Java applets are facing increasing implementation hurdles due to their maintenance and support requirements, as well as security issues. This prompted us to update the JME editor and port it to a modern Internet programming language - JavaScript.",

	Abstract = {Aggregated Conformal Prediction is used as an effective alternative to other, more complicated and/or ambiguous methods involving various balancing measures when modelling severely imbalanced datasets. Additional explicit balancing measures other than those already apart of the Conformal Prediction framework are shown not to be required. The Aggregated Conformal Prediction procedure appears to be a promising approach for severely imbalanced datasets in order to retrieve a large majority of active minority class compounds while avoiding information loss or distortion.},

@article{Sun:2017qm,
	Abstract = {Conformal prediction has been proposed as a more rigorous way to define prediction confidence compared to other application domain concepts that have earlier been used for QSAR modeling. One main advantage of such a method is that it provides a prediction region potentially with multiple predicted labels, which contrasts to the single valued (regression) or single label (classification) output predictions by standard QSAR modeling algorithms. Standard conformal prediction might not be suitable for imbalanced data sets. Therefore, Mondrian cross-conformal prediction (MCCP) which combines the Mondrian inductive conformal prediction with cross-fold calibration sets has been introduced. In this study, the MCCP method was applied to 18 publicly available data sets that have various imbalance levels varying from 1:10 to 1:1000 (ratio of active/inactive compounds). Our results show that MCCP in general performed well on bioactivity data sets with various imbalance levels. More importantly, the method not only provides confidence of prediction and prediction regions compared to standard machine learning methods but also produces valid predictions for the minority class. In addition, a compound similarity based nonconformity measure was investigated. Our results demonstrate that although it gives valid predictions, its efficiency is much worse than that of model dependent metrics.},
