	Abstract = {A fundamental element when deriving a robust and predictive in silico model is not only the statistical quality of the model in question but, equally important, the estimate of its predictive boundaries. This work presents a new method, conformal prediction, for applicability domain estimation in the field of endocrine disruptors. The method is applied to binders and non-binders related to the oestrogen and androgen receptors. Ensembles of decision trees are used as statistical method and three different sets (dragon, rdkit and signature fingerprints) are investigated as chemical descriptors. The conformal prediction method results in valid models where there is an excellent balance in quality between the internally validated training set and the corresponding external test set, both in terms of validity and with respect to sensitivity and specificity. With this method the level of confidence can be readily altered by the user and the consequences thereof immediately inspected. Furthermore, the predictive boundaries for the derived models are rigorously defined by using the conformal prediction framework, thus no ambiguity exists as to the level of similarity needed for new compounds to be in or out of the predictive boundaries of the derived models where reliable predictions can be expected. },

	Abstract = {GARD - Genomic Allergen Rapid Detection is a cell based alternative to animal testing for identification of skin sensitizers. The assay is based on a biomarker signature comprising 200 genes measured in an in vitro model of dendritic cells following chemical stimulations, and consistently reports predictive performances ~90% for classification of external test sets. Within the field of in vitro skin sensitization testing, definition of applicability domain is often neglected by test developers, and assays are often considered applicable across the entire chemical space. This study complements previous assessments of model performance with an estimate of confidence in individual classifications, as well as a statistically valid determination of the applicability domain for the GARD assay. Conformal prediction was implemented into current GARD protocols, and a large external test dataset (n = 70) was classified at a confidence level of 85%, to generate a valid model with a balanced accuracy of 88%, with none of the tested chemical reactivity domains identified as outside the applicability domain of the assay. In conclusion, results presented in this study complement previously reported predictive performances of GARD with a statistically valid assessment of uncertainty in each individual prediction, thus allowing for classification of skin sensitizers with confidence.},

@article{Cortes-Ciriano:2015ec,
	Abstract = {Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) play a key role in DNA damage repair. PARP inhibitors act as chemo- and radio- sensitizers and thus potentiate the cytotoxicity of DNA damaging agents. Although PARP inhibitors are currently investigated as chemotherapeutic agents, their cross-reactivity with other members of the PARP family remains unclear. Here, we apply Proteochemometric Modelling (PCM) to model the activity of 181 compounds on 12 human PARPs. We demonstrate that PCM (R0 (2) test =0.65-0.69; RMSEtest =0.95-1.01 $\,^{\circ}$C) displays higher performance on the test set (interpolation) than Family QSAR and Family QSAM (Tukey's HSD, α 0.05), and outperforms Inductive Transfer knowledge among targets (Tukey's HSD, α 0.05). We benchmark the predictive signal of 8 amino acid and 11 full-protein sequence descriptors, obtaining that all of them (except for SOCN) perform at the same level of statistical significance (Tukey's HSD, α 0.05). The extrapolation power of PCM to new compounds (RMSE=1.02$\pm$0.80 $\,^{\circ}$C) and targets (RMSE=1.03$\pm$0.50 $\,^{\circ}$C) is comparable to interpolation, although the extrapolation ability is not uniform across the chemical and the target space. For this reason, we also provide confidence intervals calculated with conformal prediction. In addition, we present the R package conformal, which permits the calculation of confidence intervals for regression and classification caret models.},

	Abstract = {Conformal prediction is introduced as an alternative approach to domain applicability estimation. The advantages of using conformal prediction are as follows: First, the approach is based on a consistent and well-defined mathematical framework. Second, the understanding of the confidence level concept in conformal predictions is straightforward, e.g. a confidence level of 0.8 means that the conformal predictor will commit, at most, 20% errors (i.e., true values outside the assigned prediction range). Third, the confidence level can be varied depending on the situation where the model is to be applied and the consequences of such changes are readily understandable, i.e. prediction ranges are increased or decreased, and the changes can immediately be inspected. We demonstrate the usefulness of conformal prediction by applying it to 10 publicly available data sets. },

@article{Awale:2017is,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several web-based tools have been reported recently which predict the possible targets of a small molecule by similarity to compounds of known bioactivity using molecular fingerprints (fps), however predictions in each case rely on similarities computed from only one or two fps. Considering that structural similarity and therefore the predicted targets strongly depend on the method used for comparison, it would be highly desirable to predict targets using a broader set of fps simultaneously.
RESULTS: Herein, we present the polypharmacology browser (PPB), a web-based platform which predicts possible targets for small molecules by searching for nearest neighbors using ten different fps describing composition, substructures, molecular shape and pharmacophores. PPB searches through 4613 groups of at least 10 same target annotated bioactive molecules from ChEMBL and returns a list of predicted targets ranked by consensus voting scheme and p value. A validation study across 670 drugs with up to 20 targets showed that combining the predictions from all 10 fps gives the best results, with on average 50% of the known targets of a drug being correctly predicted with a hit rate of 25%. Furthermore, when profiling a new inhibitor of the calcium channel TRPV6 against 24 targets taken from a safety screen panel, we observed inhibition in 5 out of 5 targets predicted by PPB and in 7 out of 18 targets not predicted by PPB. The rate of correct (5/12) and incorrect (0/12) predictions for this compound by PPB was comparable to that of other web-based prediction tools.
CONCLUSION: PPB offers a versatile platform for target prediction based on multi-fingerprint comparisons, and is freely accessible at www.gdb.unibe.ch as a valuable support for drug discovery.Graphical abstract.},

	Abstract = {The increasing size of datasets in drug discovery makes it challenging to build robust and accurate predictive models within a reasonable amount of time. In order to investigate the effect of dataset sizes on predictive performance and modelling time, ligand-based regression models were trained on open datasets of varying sizes of up to 1.2 million chemical structures. For modelling, two implementations of support vector machines (SVM) were used. Chemical structures were described by the signatures molecular descriptor. Results showed that for the larger datasets, the LIBLINEAR SVM implementation performed on par with the well-established libsvm with a radial basis function kernel, but with dramatically less time for model building even on modest computer resources. Using a non-linear kernel proved to be infeasible for large data sizes, even with substantial computational resources on a computer cluster. To deploy the resulting models, we extended the Bioclipse decision support framework to support models from LIBLINEAR and made our models of logD and solubility available from within Bioclipse. },

	Abstract = {Technological advances in high-throughput screening methods, combinatorial chemistry and the design of virtual libraries have evolved in the pursuit of challenging drug targets. Over the last two decades a vast amount of data has been generated within these fields and as a consequence data mining methods have been developed to extract key pieces of information from these large data pools. Much of this data is now available in the public domain. This has been helpful in the arena of drug discovery for both academic groups and for small to medium sized enterprises which previously would not have had access to such data resources. Commercial data mining software is sometimes prohibitively expensive and the alternate open source data mining software is gaining momentum in both academia and in industrial applications as the costs of research and development continue to rise. KNIME, the Konstanz Information Miner, has emerged as a leader in open source data mining tools. KNIME provides an integrated solution for the data mining requirements across the drug discovery pipeline through a visual assembly of data workflows drawing from an extensive repository of tools.

	Abstract = {In silico prediction of drug-target interactions from heterogeneous biological data can advance our system-level search for drug molecules and therapeutic targets, which efforts have not yet reached full fruition. In this work, we report a systematic approach that efficiently integrates the chemical, genomic, and pharmacological information for drug targeting and discovery on a large scale, based on two powerful methods of Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The performance of the derived models was evaluated and verified with internally five-fold cross-validation and four external independent validations. The optimal models show impressive performance of prediction for drug-target interactions, with a concordance of 82.83%, a sensitivity of 81.33%, and a specificity of 93.62%, respectively. The consistence of the performances of the RF and SVM models demonstrates the reliability and robustness of the obtained models. In addition, the validated models were employed to systematically predict known/unknown drugs and targets involving the enzymes, ion channels, GPCRs, and nuclear receptors, which can be further mapped to functional ontologies such as target-disease associations and target-target interaction networks. This approach is expected to help fill the existing gap between chemical genomics and network pharmacology and thus accelerate the drug discovery processes.},

@article{Bender:2007ib,
	Abstract = {Preclinical Safety Pharmacology (PSP) attempts to anticipate adverse drug reactions (ADRs) during early phases of drug discovery by testing compounds in simple, in vitro binding assays (that is, preclinical profiling). The selection of PSP targets is based largely on circumstantial evidence of their contribution to known clinical ADRs, inferred from findings in clinical trials, animal experiments, and molecular studies going back more than forty years. In this work we explore PSP chemical space and its relevance for the prediction of adverse drug reactions. Firstly, in silico (computational) Bayesian models for 70 PSP-related targets were built, which are able to detect 93% of the ligands binding at IC(50) < or = 10 microM at an overall correct classification rate of about 94%. Secondly, employing the World Drug Index (WDI), a model for adverse drug reactions was built directly based on normalized side-effect annotations in the WDI, which does not require any underlying functional knowledge. This is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to predict adverse drug reactions across hundreds of categories from chemical structure alone. On average 90% of the adverse drug reactions observed with known, clinically used compounds were detected, an overall correct classification rate of 92%. Drugs withdrawn from the market (Rapacuronium, Suprofen) were tested in the model and their predicted ADRs align well with known ADRs. The analysis was repeated for acetylsalicylic acid and Benperidol which are still on the market. Importantly, features of the models are interpretable and back-projectable to chemical structure, raising the possibility of rationally engineering out adverse effects. By combining PSP and ADR models new hypotheses linking targets and adverse effects can be proposed and examples for the opioid mu and the muscarinic M2 receptors, as well as for cyclooxygenase-1 are presented. It is hoped that the generation of predictive models for adverse drug reactions is able to help support early SAR to accelerate drug discovery and decrease late stage attrition in drug discovery projects. In addition, models such as the ones presented here can be used for compound profiling in all development stages.},

	Abstract = {Target identification of the known bioactive compounds and novel synthetic analogs is a very important research field in medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, and pharmacology. It is also a challenging and costly step towards chemical biology and phenotypic screening. In silico identification of potential biological targets for chemical compounds offers an alternative avenue for the exploration of ligand-target interactions and biochemical mechanisms, as well as for investigation of drug repurposing. Computational target fishing mines biologically annotated chemical databases and then maps compound structures into chemogenomical space in order to predict the biological targets. We summarize the recent advances and applications in computational target fishing, such as chemical similarity searching, data mining/machine learning, panel docking, and the bioactivity spectral analysis for target identification. We then described in detail a new web-based target prediction tool, TargetHunter (http://www.cbligand.org/TargetHunter). This web portal implements a novel in silico target prediction algorithm, the Targets Associated with its MOst SImilar Counterparts, by exploring the largest chemogenomical databases, ChEMBL. Prediction accuracy reached 91.1% from the top 3 guesses on a subset of high-potency compounds from the ChEMBL database, which outperformed a published algorithm, multiple-category models. TargetHunter also features an embedded geography tool, BioassayGeoMap, developed to allow the user easily to search for potential collaborators that can experimentally validate the predicted biological target(s) or off target(s). TargetHunter therefore provides a promising alternative to bridge the knowledge gap between biology and chemistry, and significantly boost the productivity of chemogenomics researchers for in silico drug design and discovery.},

	Abstract = {Computational target fishing methods are designed to identify the most probable target of a query molecule. This process may allow the prediction of the bioactivity of a compound, the identification of the mode of action of known drugs, the detection of drug polypharmacology, drug repositioning or the prediction of the adverse effects of a compound. The large amount of information regarding the bioactivity of thousands of small molecules now allows the development of these types of methods. In recent years, we have witnessed the emergence of many methods for in silico target fishing. Most of these methods are based on the similarity principle, i.e., that similar molecules might bind to the same targets and have similar bioactivities. However, the difficult validation of target fishing methods hinders comparisons of the performance of each method. In this review, we describe the different methods developed for target prediction, the bioactivity databases most frequently used by these methods, and the publicly available programs and servers that enable non-specialist users to obtain these types of predictions. It is expected that target prediction will have a large impact on drug development and on the functional food industry. },

	Abstract = {The global set of relationships between protein targets of all drugs and all disease-gene products in the human protein-protein interaction or 'interactome' network remains uncharacterized. We built a bipartite graph composed of US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs and proteins linked by drug-target binary associations. The resulting network connects most drugs into a highly interlinked giant component, with strong local clustering of drugs of similar types according to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification. Topological analyses of this network quantitatively showed an overabundance of 'follow-on' drugs, that is, drugs that target already targeted proteins. By including drugs currently under investigation, we identified a trend toward more functionally diverse targets improving polypharmacology. To analyze the relationships between drug targets and disease-gene products, we measured the shortest distance between both sets of proteins in current models of the human interactome network. Significant differences in distance were found between etiological and palliative drugs. A recent trend toward more rational drug design was observed.},

	Abstract = {Drug-target interactions (DTIs) are central to current drug discovery processes and public health fields. Analyzing the DTI profiling of the drugs helps to infer drug indications, adverse drug reactions, drug-drug interactions, and drug mode of actions. Therefore, it is of high importance to reliably and fast predict DTI profiling of the drugs on a genome-scale level. Here, we develop the TargetNet server, which can make real-time DTI predictions based only on molecular structures, following the spirit of multi-target SAR methodology. Na{\"\i}ve Bayes models together with various molecular fingerprints were employed to construct prediction models. Ensemble learning from these fingerprints was also provided to improve the prediction ability. When the user submits a molecule, the server will predict the activity of the user's molecule across 623 human proteins by the established high quality SAR model, thus generating a DTI profiling that can be used as a feature vector of chemicals for wide applications. The 623 SAR models related to 623 human proteins were strictly evaluated and validated by several model validation strategies, resulting in the AUC scores of 75-100 %. We applied the generated DTI profiling to successfully predict potential targets, toxicity classification, drug-drug interactions, and drug mode of action, which sufficiently demonstrated the wide application value of the potential DTI profiling. The TargetNet webserver is designed based on the Django framework in Python, and is freely accessible at http://targetnet.scbdd.com .},

	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Polypharmacology has emerged as an essential paradigm for modern drug discovery process. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that agents capable of modulating multiple targets in a selective manner may offer also improved balance between therapeutic efficacy and safety compared to single-targeted agents. Areas covered: Herein, the authors review the recent progress made in experimental and computational strategies for addressing the critical challenges with rational discovery of selective multi-targeted agents within the context of polypharmacological modelling. Specific focus is placed on multi-targeted mono-therapies, although examples of combinatorial polytherapies are also covered as an important part of the polypharmacology paradigm. The authors focus mainly on anti-cancer treatment applications, where polypharmacology is playing a key role in determining the efficacy-toxicity trade-off of multi-targeting strategies. Expert opinion: Even though it is widely appreciated that complex polypharmacological interactions can contribute both to therapeutic and adverse side-effects, systematic approaches for improving this balance by means of integrated experimental-computational strategies are still lacking. Future developments will be needed for comprehensive collection and harmonization of systems-wide target selectivity data, enabling better utilization and control for multi-targeted activities in the drug development process. Additional areas of future developments include model-based strategies for drug combination screening and improved pre-clinical validation options with animal models.},

	Abstract = {Polypharmacology describes the activity of compounds at multiple targets. Current research focuses on two aspects of polypharmacology: (1) unintended polypharmacology can lead to adverse effects; (2) polypharmacology across several disease-relevant targets can improve therapeutic efficacy, prevent drug resistance, or reduce therapeutic-target-related adverse effects. This perspective reviews these interconnected aspects of polypharmacology. The first part discusses the relevance of polypharmacology for the safety of drugs, the mitigation of safety risks, and methods to identify polypharmacological compounds early in the drug discovery process. The second part discusses the advantages of polypharmacology in the treatment of multigenic diseases and infections, and opportunities for drug discovery and drug repurposing. This perspective aims to provide a balanced view on polypharmacology, which can compromise the safety of drugs, but can also confer superior efficacy. },

@article{Sun:2017qm,
	Abstract = {Conformal prediction has been proposed as a more rigorous way to define prediction confidence compared to other application domain concepts that have earlier been used for QSAR modeling. One main advantage of such a method is that it provides a prediction region potentially with multiple predicted labels, which contrasts to the single valued (regression) or single label (classification) output predictions by standard QSAR modeling algorithms. Standard conformal prediction might not be suitable for imbalanced data sets. Therefore, Mondrian cross-conformal prediction (MCCP) which combines the Mondrian inductive conformal prediction with cross-fold calibration sets has been introduced. In this study, the MCCP method was applied to 18 publicly available data sets that have various imbalance levels varying from 1:10 to 1:1000 (ratio of active/inactive compounds). Our results show that MCCP in general performed well on bioactivity data sets with various imbalance levels. More importantly, the method not only provides confidence of prediction and prediction regions compared to standard machine learning methods but also produces valid predictions for the minority class. In addition, a compound similarity based nonconformity measure was investigated. Our results demonstrate that although it gives valid predictions, its efficiency is much worse than that of model dependent metrics.},
