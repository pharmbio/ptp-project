# PTP Meeting 14 March 2018

Attending: Ola, Jonathan, Samuel, Ernst

- Do calibration plots
  - Seems it has to be done within CPSign, since it has the data already for
    the validity value it outputs
- Use test set without the assumed negatives
  - Use assumed negatives in training but not in evaluation
  - CPSign should have some way to use some data only in the training (not the calibration)
- Include batch ID ... and do a random permutation
  - Do we see effects that are the result of different assays?
- Reg. external validation against Drugbank:
  - InchiKeys might be different because of standardisation they've done
  - Ola suggest picking randomly from approved / withdrawn
  - Ernst suggests picking a target class for which we can use approved /
    withdrawn to train a model
  - Nina says it could ...

## Action points:

- [ ] Check with Nina how to resolve Inchi/InchiKeys
- [ ] Check with with staffan about calibration plots from cross validation
- [ ] Check with Staffan about not including presumed negatives in the neither
      test (and probably not in calibration either)
