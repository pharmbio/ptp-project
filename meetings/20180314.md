# PTP Meeting 14 March 2018

Attending: Ola, Jonathan, Samuel, Ernst

- Do calibration plots
  - Seems it has to be done within CPSign, since it has the data already for
    the validity value it outputs
- Use test set without the assumed negatives
  - Use assumed negatives in training but not in evaluation
  - CPSign should have some way to use some data only in the training (not the calibration)
- Include batch ID ... and do a random permutation
  - Do we see effects that are the result of different assays?
- Reg. external validation against Drugbank:
  - InchiKeys might be different because of standardisation they've done
  - Ola suggest picking randomly from approved / withdrawn
  - Ernst suggests picking a target class for which we can use approved /
    withdrawn to train a model
  - Nina says it could ...

## Action points:

- [X] Check with Nina how to resolve Inchi/InchiKeys
  - Confirmed by Nina that Inchis might differ due to standardization.
  - We will try with ChEMBL/PubChem IDs instead.
  - Backup would be to generate new InChi/InChiKeys with the exact same method
    for DrugBank as done in ExcapeDB.
  - So, what we want to do, is to remove from the ExcapeDB, all the compounds available in DrugBank.
  - Possibly the other way around too?
- [ ] Get overlap info about DrugBank vs ExcapeDB (Samuel)
  1. How many in ExcapeDB AND DrugBank
  2. How many in ExcapeDB AND NOT DrugBank
  3. How many in DrugBank AND NOT ExcapeDB
  4. How many in ExcapeDB AND DrugBank AND NOT IN (ExcapeDB AND DrugBank) (Complement to 1.)
- [ ] Check with with Staffan about calibration plots from cross validation
- [ ] Check with Staffan about not including presumed negatives in the neither
      test (and probably not in calibration either)
- [ ] ...
