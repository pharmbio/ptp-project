# PTP Meeting 6 Nov 2017

Participants: Jonathan, Staffan, Ola, Samuel

## Action points

- [x] Ola to ask for more CPU hours
- Samuel to:
- [ ] Start writing
- [ ] Rerun the current run with 2 more replicates, to get some
  variance of the efficiency measures
- [ ] Implement drawing random "assumed negative" examples, up to
  double the size of the number of active compounds for each model.
- [ ] Fix plot:
  - [ ] Adjust so plotted circles align in middle of the stacks
  - [ ] Use same color for blue and green lines, but with some other variation,
    like line type and "ball" type
