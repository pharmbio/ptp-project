Questions and Answers
---------------------

- Do stratified classification?
  - We delay this and see how good it gets with the other modifications first.
  - Ola thinks it is not clarified completely how much it helps.
- Do we fill upp with non-active compounds?
  - We delay this also, and see how good it gets with the other modifications first.
  - `--proper-train` flag in cpsign has thus lower prio too.
