========================

Participants: Ola, Jonathan, Staffan, Arvid, Samuel

Action points
-------------

- [ ] Ola to send conformal prediction-reading list to Samuel (reminder)
- [ ] Staffan to implement the new measure ("EFF" ... something with fuzziness)

Questions and Answers
---------------------

- Do stratified classification?
  - We delay this and see how good it gets with the other modifications first.
  - Ola thinks it is not clarified completely how much it helps.
- Do we fill upp with non-active compounds?
  - We delay this also, and see how good it gets with the other modifications first.
  - `--proper-train` flag in cpsign has thus lower prio too.
