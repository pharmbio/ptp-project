# Questions for next PTP meeting

- How to do the efficiency averaging for selecting best cost/gamma?
  - Individually per target, or as an average value across all targets?
  - Should we weigh efficiency values for targets per the number of ligands?

- Do we need to do any type of filtering of the data ... such as only selecting
  compounds with IC50/EC50 or ... values? ... or those with value over
  10microMolar? (Like in the TargetNet paper)

- Do we need to take any measures to guarantee that we have balance between
  positive and negative examples in our data?
