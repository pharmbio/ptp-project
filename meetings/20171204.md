# PTP meeting 2017-12-04

Participating: Ola, Jonathan, Staffan, Samuel

- Samuel: Tried running with replicates now, and with the new efficiency measure.
  - [ ] Ola: Let's plot the new observed fuzziness score both with and without
    the class-averaging (Samuel).
- Samuel: We found some inconsistencies in the data.
  - [ ] Needs more investigation as to whether it is like this in the original
    ExcapeDB data, or has shown up in our own workflow (Samuel).
- How to filter contradictory and possibly duplicate data?
  - Ola: Probably remove
  - Jonalv: For contradictory data, we might want to do majority voting
